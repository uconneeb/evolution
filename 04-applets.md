## [Selective Sweep]({{ "applets/sweep/" | relative_url }})

This applet starts off with a new beneficial mutation in the center of one chromosome in a population of 25 diploid individuals. Red shading denotes chromosome segments that are identical to the chromosome on which the mutation arose. Each generation, crossing over breaks up the red parts, but the new mutation quickly becomes fixed due to its high fitness. A small region around the mutation is also fixed (hitchhiking) and is shown in dark purple once fixation of the selected gene occurs. Refresh your browser to start again.

## [Ball Drop]({{ "applets/ball-drop/" | relative_url }})

Random mutation and natural selection have already found a good solution to this ball packing problem. Can you find a better solution? Your goal is to drop balls into the pit in an order that maximizes the fraction of the pit area occupied by balls. After you play, the app will tell you how well you did compared to the best solution found by 50 generations of natural selection in a population of 50 haploid individuals.

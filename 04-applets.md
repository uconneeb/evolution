## [Ball Drop]({{ "applets/ball-drop/" | relative_url }})

Random mutation and natural selection have already found a good solution to this ball packing problem. Can you find a better solution? Your goal is to drop balls into the pit such that the fraction of the pit area occupied by balls is maximized. After you play, the app will tell you how well you did compared to the best solution found by 50 generations of natural selection in a population of 10 haploid individuals.

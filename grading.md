## For everyone enrolled
![From Darwin's 1837 "B" notebook]({{ "/assets/img/533px-Darwin_Tree_1837.png" | relative_url }}){:.rightsideimage width="200px"}

There are several sources of points that you can earn in this course:
* **Exams** The course will offer four 100 point exams. Please take note of the dates of these exams on the [Schedule]({{ "/schedule" | relative }}) page and plan to be present to take all four exams. 
* **Participation** A total of 40 points will be derived from participating in activities during lecture. Not every lecture will have associated participation points, and the points will come from a variety of activities. There will probably be more than 40 points offered during the semester, but 40 is the maximum you can earn.
* **Bonus** There will be 2-3 bonus exercises offered during the course for a total of 10 possible bonus points. The bonus points you earn can be used to make up for lost points on exams. 

A sample grade calculation follows: if you received 78, 95, 85, 99 as exam scores, 8 bonus points, and 40 participation points, your overall percentage would be calculated as follows: 

92.0 = 100*(78 + 95 + 85 + 99 + 8 + 40)/440

(Note that the bonus points add to the numerator but not the denominator.) Looking up 92.0 in the grading scale posted below, you would receive a letter grade of A- for the course because 92.0 is greater than or equal to 90 but less than 93.

Grades will be posted in the _My Grades_ section of [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/).

We do not anticipate "curving" grades at the end of the semester, and no bonus points other than the 10 discussed above will be offered.

## For those enrolled in EEB 2245W

For W students your final grade in the _lecture portion_ of the course will be calculated as
above. This lecture grade will constitute 75% of your final course grade, with the remaining 25%
coming from the W portion of the course, as determined by your "W" instructor. **Please note
that an F in either the W or lecture portion of the course will result in an F for the entire
course.** The [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/) site associated with this course will have information on the W
portion of the course, but you should communicate with your W instructor for full details.

## Grading scale

The following grading scale applies to all students in either EEB 2245 or EEB 2245W. This scale is based on the [way UConn calculates your grade point average](https://catalog.uconn.edu/academic-regulations/grade-information/).

| Letter Grade | If your overall percentage is greater than or equal to this | and your overall percentage is less than this |

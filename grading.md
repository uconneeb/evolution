![From Darwin's 1837 "B" notebook]({{ "/assets/img/533px-Darwin_Tree_1837.png" | relative_url }}){:.rightsideimage width="200px"}

Your grade will be based on your performance on lecture exams. There will be four exams
throughout the semesterâ€”two in the first half of the course and two in the second half of the
course. Grades will be posted in the _My Grades_ section of [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/).

## EEB 2245W

For W students your final grade in the lecture portion of the course will be calculated as
above. This lecture grade will constitute 75% of your final course grade, with the remaining 25%
coming from the W portion of the course, as determined by your "W" instructor. **Please note
that an F in either the W or lecture portion of the course will result in an F for the entire
course.** Refer to the [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/) site associated with this course for detailed information on the W
portion of the course. 
{% comment %}
You will be assigned a W instructor at an initial in-person meeting, a
mandatory library session. Please sign up for a library session in [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/) by January 24th (you will get an email invitation via your UConn email account if you are enrolled in 2245W).
If you are enrolled in EEB 2245 and wish to switch to EEB 2245W, please contact Dr. L. Lewis
to get on the waiting list.

## Grading scale

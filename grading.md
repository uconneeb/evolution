![From Darwin's 1837 "B" notebook]({{ "/assets/img/533px-Darwin_Tree_1837.png" | relative_url }}){:.rightsideimage width="200px"}

The course will offer four 100 point exams. Of these, we will drop the lowest score of one exam; retaining three exam scores. If you miss an exam, that exam will be your dropped score. There will be three bonus exercises offered in the course for a total of 10 possible bonus points. The bonus points you earn will be added to your best three exam scores. A sample grade calculation follows: if you received 78, 95, 85, 99 as exam scores and **9 bonus points** your score would be 96% or (95+85+99+**9**)=288 points out of 300. Grades will be posted in the _My Grades_ section of [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/).

## EEB 2245W

For W students your final grade in the lecture portion of the course will be calculated as
above. This lecture grade will constitute 75% of your final course grade, with the remaining 25%
coming from the W portion of the course, as determined by your "W" instructor. **Please note
that an F in either the W or lecture portion of the course will result in an F for the entire
course.** The [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/) site associated with this course will have information on the W
portion of the course, but you should communicate with your assigned W instructor for full details.

## Grading scale

The following grading scale applies to all students in either EEB 2245 or EEB 2245W. This scale is based on the [way UConn calculates your grade point average](https://catalog.uconn.edu/academic-regulations/grade-information/).

| Letter Grade | If your overall percentage is greater than or equal to this | and your overall percentage is less than this |

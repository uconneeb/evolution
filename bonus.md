## Biologically-inspired design

This bonus exercise is worth up to 5 points. You must complete it by 11:59pm Friday March 3 to get credit. Although it is set up as a "test" in HuskyCT, that is only to make it easier for us to grade it and to centralize everything in HuskyCT; there is no penalty for skipping this.

### Find an example of biologically-inspired design
#### Rules
* must be different than anything turned in by another student (or discussed in lecture) 
* must provide the scientific name (binomial) of the organism that served as inspiration (correctly italicized) 
* must briefly describe what design aspect was inspired by the organism IN YOUR OWN WORDS (no quotes allowed, no  plagiarism) 
* must provide a citation including authors (can use "et al." if more than 2 authors), year, title, and journal
* must provide the Document Object Identifier (DOI) to the peer-reviewed paper in a scientific journal that describes this example

#### DOIs already taken

Below is a list of DOIs that have already been claimed by other students. Please check this list before you put a lot of work into a particular example because you will not get any bonus points if you use the same DOI as someone who turned in the assignment before you.

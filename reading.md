Specific reading assignments in the textbook (Herron and Freeman, Evolutionary Analysis, 5th ed.) for each lecture. 

Note that this page will be updated frequently throughout the semester.

### Lecture 1 (Why study evolution?)

There are no reading assignments for the first lecture.

### Lecture 2 (Phylogenies and tree thinking) 

{% comment %}
10 pages
{% endcomment %}

* Section 4.1 (How to read an evolutionary tree), pp. 110-114
* Section 4.2 (The logic of inferring evolutionary trees), through "Outgroup analysis", pp. 114-118

### Lecture 3 (How phylogenies are made)

{% comment %}
(123-117)+(128-127)+(133-132)+(140-136) = 12 pages
{% endcomment %}

* Section 4.2 (The logic of inferring evolutionary trees), "Parsimony analysis" to end, pp. 118-123

{% endcomment %}

* Section 15.5 (The locus of adaptation in natural populations), pp. 601-606

### Lecture 8 (Modeling natural selection)

This is a lot of reading! You need not read all of this. Treat this as suggestions for 
sections in the textbook that can provide alternative (and more in-depth) explanations
of what I mention in lecture. That is, if what is presented in lecture is perfectly clear, 
you may not need to look at these readings. 

* Section 6.1 (Mendelian genetics in populations: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), pp. 180-191
* Section 6.2 (Selection), pp. 191-201
* Section 6.3 (Patterns of selection: testing predictions of population genetics theory), pp. 201-214

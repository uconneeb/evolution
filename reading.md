Specific reading assignments in the textbook (Herron and Freeman, Evolutionary Analysis, 5th ed.) for each lecture. 

Note that this page will be updated frequently throughout the semester.

### Lecture 1 (Why study evolution?)

There are no reading assignments for the first lecture.

### Lecture 2 (Phylogenies and tree thinking) 

{% comment %}
10 pages
{% endcomment %}

* Section 4.1 (How to read an evolutionary tree), pp. 110-114
* Section 4.2 (The logic of inferring evolutionary trees), through "Outgroup analysis", pp. 114-118

### Lecture 3 (How phylogenies are made)

{% comment %}
(123-117)+(128-127)+(133-132)+(140-136) = 12 pages
{% endcomment %}

* Section 4.2 (The logic of inferring evolutionary trees), "Parsimony analysis" to end, pp. 118-123
* Section 4.3 (Molecular phylogeny inference and the origin of whales), just "Evaluating alternative phylogenies with likelihood" (p. 128) and "Bayesian phylogeny inference" (p. 133)
* Section 4.4 (Using phylogenies to answer questions), pp. 137-140

Note: you do **not** need to read Computing consequences 4.1 and 4.2

* Section 3.5 (The nature of natural selection), pp. 90-94

### Lecture 5 (Quantitative trait evolution)

{% comment %}
(90-80)+(347-342)+(353-347)+(360-355) = 26 pages
{% endcomment %}

### Lecture 7 (Selection at a single locus)

{% comment %}
(201-190)+(214-200) = 25 pages
{% endcomment %}

* Section 15.5 (The locus of adaptation in natural populations), pp. 601-606

### Lecture 8 (Modeling natural selection)

This (below) represents a lot of reading! You need not read all of this. Treat this as suggestions for 
sections in the textbook that can provide alternative (and more in-depth) explanations
of what I mention in lecture. That is, if what is presented in lecture is perfectly clear, 
you may not need to look at these readings. 

* Section 6.1 (Mendelian genetics in populations: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), pp. 180-191
* Section 6.2 (Selection), pp. 191-201
* Section 6.3 (Patterns of selection: testing predictions of population genetics theory), pp. 201-214

### Lecture 9 (Molecular evolution, sexual selection)

As always, use the following reading to enhance your understanding of the subjects discussed in lecture. 
Questions on exams will not come from reading if the topic is not also discussed in lecture.

* Section 5.2 (Where new alleles come from: How mutations alter protein function), pp. 159-161.
* Chapter 11 is on sexual selection, but the following sections are most relevant
* Section 11.2 (Sexual selection on males: competition), pp. 417-423
* Section 11.3 (Sexual selection on males: female choice), pp. 423-441

### Lecture 10 (Multilevel selection, inclusive fitness)

These are the most relevant sections for the material covered in lecture. 
You are welcome to read more, however. You might find the section on "Kin Selection and Human Behavior" quite interesting!
* pp. 320-321 (in particular Muller's ratchet and the discussion of fig. 8.28)
* pp. 471-473 (Multilevel selection and Cooperation)

### Lecture 11 (Inclusive fitness, haplodiploidy in bees, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium)
* pp. 460-461 (Inclusive Fitness section)
* pp. 483-486 (The evolution of eusociality)

### Lecture 12 (Out of equilibrium: non-random mating, mutation, migration, selection, drift; gene trees and coalescence)
* pp. 240-251 (genetic drift, note figures 7.15 and 7.16)
* pp. 272-274 (coalescence)

### Lecture 13 (Using Fst, migration-selection balance)
* pp. 237-239 (Empirical research on migration versus selection)
* pp. 257-259 (Genetic drift versus natural selection)

### Lecture 14 (Introduction to speciation, species concepts, isolation)
* pp. 609-616 (Species concepts)
* pp. 616-620 (Beginning of isolation)

### Lecture 15 (Isolation)
* pp. 620-623 (Isolation continued)

### Lecture 16 (divergence)
* pp. 623-629 (Divergence)

### Lecture 17 (hybridization, diversification, adaptation)
* pp. 629-637 (Hybridization)
* pp. 637-641 (Diversification)
* pp. ###-### (Adaptation)

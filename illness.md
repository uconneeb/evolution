If illness prevents you from taking an exam, it is your responsibility to notify your lecture instructor ([Dr. Lewis](mailto:paul.lewis@uconn.edu) first half, [Dr. McAssey](mailto:edward.mcassey@uconn.edu) second half) as soon as possible, and **definitely before the exam takes place**. You do not need to disclose the nature of your illness, however, you will need to work with your lecture instructor to determine when (or whether) you will be able to take the exam.

If you are enrolled in the W version of the course, and if illness is preventing you from completing your W assignments, it is your responsibility to discuss your situation with your W instructor ([Dr. David Wagner](mailto:david.wagner@uconn.edu)).

If life circumstances are affecting your ability to focus on courses and your UConn experience, students can email the Dean of Students at [dos@uconn.edu](mailto:dos@uconn.edu) to request support. Regional campus students should email the Student Services staff at their home campus to request support and faculty notification.

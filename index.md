# EEB 2245/2245W (Evolutionary Biology)<br/>Spring 2023

EEB 2245/W is a course in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/). The primary goal of the course is to teach the basic principles of evolutionary biology and the history of life on earth. 

Below you will find basic information about the course. Visit the menu items at the top for more information.

## Meeting time

The course meets every Tuesday and Thursday 9:30 to 10:45 am in [GW002](https://classrooms.uconn.edu/classroom/gw-002/), which is located in the [Gant West Building](https://goo.gl/maps/TqN3PAHhUCvvLv5z5). Few lecture materials will be posted online, so it is important to attend lecture in person. Some activities with associated participation points require you to be physically present in the lecture room.

## Evaluations and Grading

Please see the [Grading](/grading) page for details about how your learning will be assessed this semester.

## HuskyCT

We will use [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu) for recording grades and for some other activities.

## Assigned readings and activities

Indicated on the [lecture schedule](lecture-schedule).

Even though you are not enrolled in the W version of the course, you will nevertheless see rows in the HuskyCT _My Grades_ section that pertain only to W students. If you are not in the W version of the course, you need not worry that you have no grade in grade book rows clearly labeled as part of the W course.

## Learning objectives

Our primary objective is to familiarize you with the mechanisms of evolutionary change (processes of evolution), major patterns of evolution, and the history of the diversity of life.

More specifically, you will:
* appreciate why an understanding of evolutionary processes is important (in particular to human health)
* understand the process of adaptation and how it is achieved through natural selection
* be able to define evolution and list several processes by which organisms evolve
* apply your knowledge of evolutionary processes to data in order to formulate testable hypotheses
* be able to summarize peer-reviewed primary research in evolutionary biology

# EEB 2245/2245W (Evolution)

EEB 2245/W is a course in the [Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://www.eeb.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/). The primary goal of the course is to teach the basic principles of evolutionary biology and the history of life on earth. 

Below you will find basic information about the course. Visit the menu items at the top for more information.

## Meeting time

The course is entirely online. The lectures (at least in the first half of the course) will involve pre-recorded 30-min lectures, which you are expected to listen to before class, followed on-line (synchronous) discussion sessions during the nominal class meeting times (Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30-10:45am). 

## Textbook

Futuyma, D. J., and M. Kirkpatrick. _Evolution_. 4th ed. Sinauer Associates/Oxford University Press ([ISBN 978-1-60535-605-1](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/evolution-9781605356051?lang=en&cc=us)).

## Assigned readings and activities

Indicated on the [lecture schedule](lecture-schedule). Please watch the lecture video (posted to HuskyCT) and read the assigned material before the lecture discussion begins.

## W section

This web site contains information for the _lecture_ component of the course only. Please see [Grading](grading) for information related to the W portion of the course (only relevant for those enrolled in EEB-2245W).

## Learning objectives

Our primary objective is to familiarize you with the mechanisms of evolutionary change (processes of evolution), major patterns of evolution, and the history of the diversity of life.

More specifically, you will:
* appreciate why an understanding of evolutionary processes is important (in particular to human health)
* understand the process of adaptation and how it is achieved through natural selection
* be able to define evolution and list several processes by which organisms evolve
* apply your knowledge of evolutionary processes to data in order to formulate testable hypotheses
* be able to summarize peer-reviewed primary research in evolutionary biology

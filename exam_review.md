## Review sessions

Your 2245 TAs will be offering an optional review session prior to each exam. You are not required to attend these sessions, but you may find them useful. These sessions will be held on Husky CT and will be recorded. Ahead of the review sessions, the TAs will ask you to submit questions that you would like answered. This way, even if you are unable to make the review session, you can still get your question answered. Note that these sessions are open door, so you may come and leave at point. 
Review session times will be announced in lecture and posted on this page as they are scheduled.

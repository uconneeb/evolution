## Review Sessions
Your 2245 TAs (Katie and Kaitlin) will be offering optional review session prior to each exam. You are not required to attend these sessions, but you may find them useful. You will likely get the most out of them if you bring your questions from lecture and/or the textbook. Note that these sessions are open door, so you may come and leave at point in the two hour window.

Review session times will be announced in lecture and posted on this page as they are scheduled.

#### Exam 1
Review session #1: Thursday February 7th at 6-8 pm

Review session #2: Monday February 11th at 4-6 pm

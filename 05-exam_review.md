## Review sessions

Your 2245 TAs (Katie and Kaitlin) will be offering optional review session prior to each exam and activity discussions. You are not required to attend these sessions, but you may find them useful. You will likely get the most out of them if you bring your questions from lecture and/or the textbook. Note that these sessions are open door, so you may come and leave at point.

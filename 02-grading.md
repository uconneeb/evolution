## EEB 2245

Your grade will be based on your performance on lecture exams. There will be four exams
throughout the semesterâ€”two in the first half of the course and two in the second half of the
course. Your lowest grade out the four exams will be dropped. Thus, your grade will be based on
your three top lecture exam grades. **Please note: because you are allowed to drop one of these
grades, we will not give make-up exams.** Grades will be posted in the [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/)  gradebook 
(and grades are the only thing you will use HuskyCT for unless you are enrolled in the W version of this course).

## EEB 2245W

For W students your final grade in the lecture portion of the course will be calculated as
above. This lecture grade will constitute 75% of your final course grade, with the remaining 25%
coming from the W portion of the course, as determined by your "W" instructor. **Please note
that an F in either the W or lecture portion of the course will result in an F for the entire
course.** Dr. Louise Lewis ([louise.lewis@uconn.edu](mailto:louise.lewis@uconn.edu)) is the coordinator of the W portion of the
course. Refer to the HuskyCT site associated with this course for detailed information on the W
portion of the course. You will be assigned a W instructor at an initial in-person meeting, a
mandatory library session. Please sign up for a library session in [HuskyCT](https://huskyct.uconn.edu/) by January 24th (you will get an email invitation via your UConn email account if you are enrolled in 2245W).
If you are enrolled in EEB 2245 and wish to switch to EEB 2245W, please contact Dr. L. Lewis
to get on the waiting list.

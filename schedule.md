![Some of the fossils on display in lecture on Jan. 24, 2019](../assets/img/fossil-banner.png)_Some of the fossils on display in lecture in Spring 2019_

Lectures (Jan. 19 - Mar. 2 at least) are two-parted: (1) video on HuskyCT (watch from 9:30-10:00, or preferably earlier); (2) online discussion from 10:00-10:45 (using Collaborate within HuskyCT). This schedule is subject to change without notice (except for exam dates). Check regularly for updates!

The papers listed on this page have bee mentioned in lecture and the information is provided here for the sake of completeness. _You are **not expected** to read these papers!_ You **are expected** to understand the aspects of these studies presented in lecture.

**AF Blakeslee. 1914.** Corn and men: the interacting influence of heredity and environmentâ€”movements for betterment of men, or corn, or any other living thing, one-sided unless they take both factors into account. Journal of Heredity 5:511-518. [DOI: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a107785](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a107785) _(This is the source of the famous 1914 photo showing a normal distribution of human heights taken at UConn.)_

**SP Carroll and C. Boyd. 1992.** Host race radiation in the soapberry bug: natural history with the history. _Evolution_ 46:1052-1069. [DOI: 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1992.tb00619.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1992.tb00619.x) _(This study was discussed in some detail the week before spring break.)_

**ML Cody and JM Overton. 1996.** Short-term evolution of reduced dispersal in island plant populations. _Journal of Ecology_ 84:53-61. [DOI: 10.2307/2261699](https://doi.org/10.2307/2261699) _(This study was discussed in some detail the week before spring break.)_

**WA Cresko, A Amores, C Wilson, J Murphy, M Currey, P Phillips, MA Bell, CB Kimmel, and JH Postlethwait. 2004.** Parallel genetic basis for repeated evolution of armor loss in Alaskan threespine stickleback populations. Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA 101:6050-6055. [DOI: 10.1073/pnas.0308479101](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0308479101) _(Figure 4 provided the photo of the F2 dihybrid cross involving stickleback armor that I showed in class.)_

**JBS Haldane. 1924.** A mathematical theory of natural and artificial selection. I. Trans. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 23:19-41. (No DOI available, but it can be downloaded from [the Blackwell Publisher website](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/haldane1.pdf)) _(This paper represents the first time anyone estimated a selection coefficient for the case of peppered moths in the 1800s. See p. 26 but note that peppered moths were in the genus _Amphidasys_ rather than _Biston_ at that time.)_

**O Savolainen, M Lascoux, and J Merila. 2013.** Ecological genomics of local adaptation. Nature Reviews Genetics 14:807-820. [DOI: 10.1038/nrg3522](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3522) _(Figure 3 of this paper was shown in lecture to illustrate repeated loss of stickleback armor in freshwater lake environments.)_

**AE van't Hof, P Campagne, DJ Rigden, CJ Yung, J Lingley, MA Quail, N Hall, AC Darby, and IJ Saccheri. 2016.** The industrial melanism mutation in British peppered moths is a transposable element. Nature 534:102-107. [DOI: 10.1038/nature17951](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature17951) _(This paper describes the genetic basis of the dark (melanic) form of the peppered moth. It was mentioned after Dr. McClintock's visit because the mutation results from a transposable element.)_

**J Wang, J Ding, T Biyue, KM Robinson, IH Michelson, A Johannson, B Nystedt, DG Scofield, O Nilsson, S Jansson, NR Street, and PK Ingvarsson. 2018.** A major locus controls local adaptation and adaptive life history variation in a perennial plant. _Genome Biology_ 19:72. [DOI: 10.1186/s13059-018-1444-y](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1444-y) _(Figure 3 of this paper provided a couple of figures used in lecture when describing the selective sweep of the early-bud-formation-mutation in population of aspen in northern Sweden.)_

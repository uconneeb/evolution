Here are the questions asked during the first lecture discussion in the chat box, along with answers either by me (Paul Lewis) or Zach (Muscavitch).

## Textbook

>Are we to purchase the textbook from the bookstore?

Yes.

>Is the textbook mandatory or recommended?

The specified readings are required. You will lose some points on the exams if you do not do the readings.

>When do we need the book by?

There are readings posted for the first lecture, which was Jan. 19, so it would help to get the book as soon as possible.

>Are there any ebook version of the textbook?

Yes, there is a VitalSource ebook available.

>So with the textbook, we will read chapters on our own as well as watching lectures?

Yes, specific pages will be provided in the syllabus.

> If we find an older pdf of the textbook will that suffice or is the 4th edition required? Does the edition of the textbook matter?

Zach answered this one nicely: "If you use an older version of the book, the page numbers might not match, but the content will probably be very similar."

> Are there any extra materials beside the textbook that we need to purchase for the W section?

Zach's answer: "You should only need the textbook for the lecture portion of the course, the W section just requires you to write, write some more, and revise!" You should consult with your W instructor about requirements for the W part.

## Lectures and studying

>For future videos, will slides be posted with the videos?

Yes, and I've posted the slides for the first video too. Keep in mind that there is material on the video that is not in the slides, so the slides alone are not sufficient. I'm only providing them to you because you asked.

>Is there any tips you have for note taking during lecture? How in depth should we study/take notes for exams? 

That is a question I can't answer. You need to understand everything presented in the lecture videos. You will be tested on comprehension, not just memorization of terms. You should practice explaining the lecture topics to yourself or your roommate. If you can give a decent explanation of the lecture slides without your notes, then you are well prepared for the exam!

>Are there practice exams?

No, but I will use the lecture discussion to help prepare you for exams

>Will you provide study guides?

This answer applies only for the first half of the course. Dr. Caira will explain how things will work in the second half of the course. No, there will be no study guides posted for the first two exams. There are 6-7 lectures per exam, and the lecture videos are only 25 minutes long, on average, so you can watch all the lectures for an exam again in less than 3 hours. You should spend enough time on each video on the day of the lecture to understand it, then you can review by watching them again before the exam just to make sure you fully understand the concepts presented.

> Will there be review sessions?

Zach's answer: "...there will be a review session held by TAs before each exam, more info on the course website"

## Exams

> Will we take our exams through huskyct or lockdown browser?

Exams will be taken in HuskyCT but not using lockdown browser. You will have the normal class time to take the exam (75 min) unless you have made arrangements with the [CSD](https://csd.uconn.edu) for extra time on exams.

> Are the exams multiple choice? Are the exam questions' open-ended or multiple choice?

Some questions will be multiple choice, but there will be a variety of answers. Because we are not using lockdown browser, we will try to structure the questions so that the answer cannot be easily looked up on the internet during the exam :)

> Will the exams be at a specific time?

Yes, they will begin at 9:30am on the day shown on the schedule. 

> Are the exams cumulative?

I can't rule out some carryover. For example, the first quarter of the course is primarily concerned with natural selection, and the second quarter on other processes of evolution, such as genetic drift, speciation, etc. But we may well ask you to compare genetic drift to selection.

## Other

>What does the discussion board consist of?

We are not currently using the discussion board, but may in the future.

>Is there any additional assignments besides the exams?

Just optional bonus assignments, unless you are enrolled in the W version of the course (in which case your W instructor will explain what is expected of you).

>Do you take attendance for the online discussion?

No, but that doesn't mean it is optional. Some material is presented only in the online discussions.

>Is the discussion portion recorded?

Yes, go to Blackboard Collaborate in HuskyCT, click the menu icon, and choose Recordings to find the recordings.

>Is there a course schedule available with exam dates?

Yes, see the [online lecture schedule](https://uconneeb.github.io/evolution/lecture-schedule/)

> I was wondering if there are any resources that you have found useful in keeping up to date on evolutionary findings? I'm particularly interested in plant evolution.

Zach's answer: "...review papers are a great way to catch up on broad topics such as plant evolution." You might check out [Google Scholar alerts](https://scholar.googleblog.com/2010/06/google-scholar-alerts.html) or get the table of contents for particular journals of interest emailed to you.
